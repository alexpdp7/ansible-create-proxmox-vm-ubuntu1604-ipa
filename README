DEPRECATED, I DON'T USE THIS ANY MORE.

Just a small task to provision a Proxmox VM joined to FreeIPA.

Typical Playbook usage:

---
- hosts: <promox host>
  tasks:
    - include_role:
        name: create-proxmox-vm-ubuntu1604-ipa
      vars:
        hostname: <hostname>
        vmid: "{{ hostvars['<hostname>']['proxmox_vmid'] }}"
        ipa_domain: "{{ ipa_domain_name }}"
        ipa_username: admin
        ipa_password: "{{ ipa_admin_password }}"
        dhcp_dns_domain: "<my DHCP/DNS domain>"
        memory: 2048
        disk: 8

I keep IPA data on group_vars/all/(vars|vault) and proxmox_vmid on
host_vars/<host>/(vars|vault).

DHCP/DNS domain is required because on first boot, the host gets an ubuntu.fqdn
hostname and needs to be rebooted to work properly.

I only need a single line in the inventory for each host's hostname, and I put:

ansible_become: True
ansible_user: <my ipa username>

in the host's variables to connect.

I use DHCP/DNS so IP configuration is automatic and I can access the containers
using their hostname.
